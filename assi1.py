#  Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you
# can create a project in Django?

'''
Django is the best framework for web applications, as it allows developers to use modules for
faster development. As a developer, you can make use of these modules to create apps,
websites from an existing source. It speeds up the development process greatly, as you do
not have to code everything from scratch.
